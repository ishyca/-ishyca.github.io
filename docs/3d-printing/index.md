### How this works 

Markdown and emacs org mode does not play nice. Everything is in one file.

 The journal is created after I already throw myself into the pool. Everything that does not fall under a particular date will get classified here.

Timeline:
December 2019: - I decided on a Prusa MK3S from reddit posts. 
               - what is open-source, improvable, reasonable price, work out-of-the-box
		 - fill all your DIY pride/need/itches with assembling it as a kit. also cheaper.
               - Whichever is heavily marketed on youtube channels I follow.  
During Christmas 2019: I research 3d printing projects.
		 - OctoPrint. dig out my old Raspberry Pi 2? Model B? interesting lecture by Gina HauRge. Driving 3D Printers with Python lesson learned [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OcVmGbeh8A] 
               - open source project backlog put work to shame. whoever insane enough thought it was good idea to have infinite scroll for issue pages
               - Octoprint->Ansible, micro home server network security, deployment setup -: another rabbit hole opening up 
               - early onset of buyer regret, SLA printer would have been better for finer detail modeling 3dprint.
               - why did I not learn Blender earlier. 
Jan 2020: - I receive my printer. ok, I should not open the bag of gummie bears.
          - the screw and nut are smaller then expected. what did i get myself into. 
Feb 2020:  
 - XYZ Calibration failure 
 - First Layer failure due to extruder motor not plug in 
 - bed adhesion failure:           
 - nozzle travel path issue:
