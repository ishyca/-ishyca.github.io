[2020] 
  -
  I don't know if that is what I want later but here is what I want to finish 2020
  1. Learn basic 3d printing to be able to print figurine and case without failure.
     criteria:
     1. can print a working mini figurine model from 3d model - existing or made
     2. can print a working functional part from plan

   2. learn enough blender to model a simple figurine: a simpler model( a small octocat
   3. learn enough soldering so I can wire a fan without killing myself.
   4. learn go to understand tendermint. get it running
   5. learn react and get the UI renovated at work
   6. get octoprint setup and learn to do 1 pull request.
   7. get the daisy project setup and running.
        - tcl module load setup.
  now I can break it down.

  ====
  on the physical side.

  1. maintaining going to rock climbing 2 time per week
  2. have a good sleep schedule to go to work consistently at 9-930.
  3. take lead class and do lead.

  MOST IMPORTANT?
  MOST VALUABLE usage of my time ?

  I don't know what I want in life... but I do want to make sure I can learn those things or I will regret not having chance to do them. so do it and maybe what I w\
  ant to will be more clear later. what I want will be more clear later.
